# COMS4995-final-project
Models that trained with multiple fully connected layers have "multi-fc" been added to the end of the file name. For example, "DogClassification-inception-0.000003.ipynb" is the experiment of Inception model with a learning rate of 0.000003 without deeper fully connected layers. "DogClassification-inception-0.00001-multi-fc.ipynb" is the experiment of Inception model with a learning rate of 0.00001 with deeper fully connected layers.
In order to avoid duplicated work, I only contained code for example cropping in DogClassification-inception-0.000005-multi-fc.ipynb.
The title of some loss plot may be incorrect due to my mistake when I created it, but the value and the plot are correct.
