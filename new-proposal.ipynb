    "Description: the objective of this project is to re-train different pre-trained models with different output layer structures or learning rates to find a best setting with higher accuracy on dog classification on Stanford Dog Dataset. Considering the current existing paper and studies, the expected accuracy of this project should be higher than 80% as least."

I would tried different learning rates and different architecture of the output layers to compare the performance of the trained model on the prediction accuracy and loss. The dataset I used would be Stanford Dog Dataset."
